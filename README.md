# Frontend Mentor – Age Calculator App Solution

This is my solution to the **Age Calculator App** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q).  
The project calculates a user's exact age in years, months, and days based on the date they provide.
